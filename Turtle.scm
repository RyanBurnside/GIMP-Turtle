;; Turtle is just an associative list but we write some nice methods
;; To give the illusion of a modern class

;*** TODO
;; Add a with-state and with-undo macros 
   ;to save and restore state and undo
;; Possibly use stroked paths instead of lines, let user stroke path
;; Add a macro to copy a turtle
;***

;; Utility functions

GIMP-Turtle
=============

A simple set of functions designed to be used in the Script-Fu REPL to add precise placement and drawing commands to GIMP using turtle graphics.

This allows the user to define drawing routines in real time.
Precision lines and shapes can be made by defining a Turtle and telling it to move and face various directions.
